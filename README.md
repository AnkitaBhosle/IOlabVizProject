Project title : <b>GDP and the Players<b>

<b>Project description</b>
Our project looks at GDP, Imports and Exports. When a country exports goods, it sells them to a foreign market, that is to consumers, businesses, or governments in another country. Those exports bring money into the country, which increases the exporting nation's GDP. When a country imports goods, it buys them from foreign producers. The money spent on imports leaves the economy, and that decreases the importing nations GDP. 

How much of the statement above is validated by the data? 

Exploring answers to this question was the focus and interest of our project.
